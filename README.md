# BABI Chatbot Project

Welcome to the BABI Chatbot project! This repository contains code and resources for building a chatbot using the BABI dataset.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a chatbot using the BABI dataset, which consists of stories, questions, and answers. The chatbot is designed to answer questions based on the given stories and associated queries.

## Features 

- Trains a chatbot using the BABI dataset.
- Uses a neural network architecture to understand stories and answer questions.
- Provides sample interactions and evaluation on the test set. 

## Getting Started

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ````
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/babi-chatbot.git
   ````
2.Install the required dependencies:
      ````
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ````
      
3.Download the BABI dataset files: train_qa.txt and test_qa.txt:
  which is in Dataset file

  
4.Run the main script:
  python code/ML_chatbot.ipynb
  
## Usage
-Train the chatbot using the BABI dataset.

-Interact with the chatbot by providing stories and questions.

-Evaluate the chatbot's performance on the test set.



## Model Architecture
The chatbot utilizes a neural network architecture consisting of Embedding layers, LSTMs, and dense layers to process stories and answer questions.
